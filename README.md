## Focus 🔍

This repository focuses on the following overall tenants:

| Tenant | Outcome |
|--|--|
| _Blocks Social Media_ | Blocks distractions, timewasters and nonsense on the internet |
| _Blocks Trackers and Ads_ | Blocks privacy invading aspects of major services |
| _Blocks Security Concerns_ | Blocks some corporation domains (adobe, xiaomi etc) |
| _Provides Personal Freedom_ | Does __not__ block websites of an "adult nature" |

Please Note: Naturally this is a balancing act. At times this list will be more restrictive
than you might like.

Please configure a manual whitelist.
